<h1 id="i1">About us </h1>
<p id="i1">Playstation is a webgame platform developed by budding developers <u id="u1">Mr. Jay Goyal(1910990256)</u> ,<br> <u id="u1">Miss. Urvashi(1910990231)</u> 
and <u id="u1">Mr. Saksham Sharma(1910990285)</u> . Here we intend to provide you a <br>stressfree zone where you can play endlessly and have
great fun . <br>Score points as you proceed with the game...</p>
<br><br>
<h1 id="i2">GAMES </h1>
<p id="i2"><u id="u1">Snake</u> – The first published by Nokia, for monochrome phones <br>was 
 programmed in 1997 by Taneli Armanto of Nokia <br>and introduced on the Nokia 6110.
here we present you a basic <br>snake game thus preserving its authentic texture ... <br>
<u id="u1">Tic Tac Toe </u>-Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses <br>(Commonwealth English),or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game <br>for two players,
 X and O, who take turns marking the spaces<br> in a 3×3 grid. ... The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks<br> in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
</p><br><br>
<h1 id="i1">HOW IT STARTED</h1>
<p id="i1">We are three friends who were assigned a 
project where we could create something<br> that was very pleasing
and had something that could catch the crowd eyes <br>so while discussing amongst us came this idea
of creating our own gaming website . <br>After that we've been working on it and here we are with our very own website
<br>In <u id="u1">August 2020</u> ,our website was launched...
</p><br><br>
<h1 id="i2">Technique </h1>
<p id="i2">The game is built from scratch in plain <u id="u1">Javascript</u> using 
<u id="u1">Canvas</u> as the rendering surface
<br>with <u id="u1">CSS</u> as the hero and 
<u id="u1">HTML</u> being its survivor..
<br>After adding animation along with CSS ,hours of hard work and testing,
<br>the working prototype was turned into a full fledged game.
